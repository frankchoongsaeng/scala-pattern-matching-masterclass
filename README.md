# Scala Pattern-Matching Masterclass

This was for a four-day hands-on series that went through everything you need to know about pattern matching in Scala. 
We explored how it works, why it’s so powerful, and all the tips and tricks that can help you write cleaner, smarter code.

## What we went over:
- The basics of pattern matching and how it’s different from traditional conditionals
- Practical applications for collections, case classes, and custom extractors
- Advanced techniques like partial functions, exhaustive matching, and how to work with sealed traits

The objective goal of each attendee:
- Know how to use pattern matching to handle real-world data structures with ease
- Create custom patterns using extractors
- Apply best practices to keep your code clean, readable, and effective
